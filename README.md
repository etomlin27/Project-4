# Problem Statement:

  This project was given to better understand noise levels underwater due to; rain, wind, marine animals, air guns, and earthquakes/ valcanic
  eruptions. For this project we will use data collected from profilers in the Juan de Fuca plate, which is off the west coast of the United 
  states and Canada, and the different situations we need to analyze. Using data from a Hydrophones we are able to analyze the situations of 
  intrest and analyze noice levels under the sea. The code is writen in python and will inform the user of noice levels in this ocean caused 
  by the many cases. 

# Results:
  
  In Figures 1 to 4 the Power Spectral Density are shown agains frequency. The (a) graphs show the Oregon Shelf Cabled Benthic Experiment Package(OSCBEP) and the (b) graphs show the Oregon Offshore Cabled Benthic Experiment Package(OOCBEP). Graphs 1 to 4 are the following infromation 1:Rainy, 2: Windy, 3: Stormy, and 4: Dead. In Figure 2 the hydrophone data is shown against time.
  In the following graphs the following assumptions were made: 
  
    1. Data collected from the Hydrone is accurate

  As seen in Figure 1.a most of the earthquakes that occur are at the plate boundaries, this is due to interactions between the different plates causing stored energy to be released in the form of vibration. The Juan de Fuca Plate is unique in that it has all types of tectonic boundaries (Convergent, Divergent, and Transform). For the Juan de Fuca Plate the range of magnitudes seen is from 2.5 to 6.8 with the average magnitude being 3.1650072744907956. 
  In Figure 1.b the Month of April is shown in 2015. The most densely packed location of earthquakes is located in the middle of the west side of the Juan de Fuca Plate. This location on the plate boundary is called the Axial Seamount which is a volcano that erupted in this month and was felt around the world. This can be seen in the ripples in the southern part of Juan de Fuca Plate. The largest value from this month however is in the top of the plate.

  Figure 1.d: Earthquakes magnitudes of the Juan de Fuca Plate on the Transform
  
  Figures 1.c and 1.d are both on the Juan de Fuca Plate but are targeted regions on the plate. Figure 1.c is a Divergence boundary on the plate and Figure 1.d is a Transform. The patterns that can be made from this information is that more earthquakes occur at the Divergence boundary but more intense earthquakes will happen at the transform boundary. This information matches information I found on the cliffsnotes website.
  
  

  
  As seen in Table 1 we can see general trend from the Juan de Fuca Plate earthquakes. The most prevelent of trends being found in the average size of the earthquakes. Having the 'All Data' being the base line for reference we can see that both the Transform and April 2015 data are above average with the divergence data being below average.

   Figures 2.a to 2.d show scatter plots of the amplitudes of the earthquakes over time.
  
  
  # Conclusion:
  
  Accurate measurements of earthquakes can be made using information collected from Ocean Bottom Seismometer due to the matching data found about the Axial Seamount, Divergent and Transform Boundaries on the Juan de Fuca Plate.
